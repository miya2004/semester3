      <p>I’ve decided to start a small personal project inspired by Tamagotchi, but with a different purpose and features tailored for people like me—and my team at Takumi. <br>
        One day, we had a conversation about burnout—from university, work, and the constant stress of thinking about the future. As international students in the Netherlands, we often feel alone. We're trying to save money, stay on top of studies, and keep everything together. But sometimes, all that pressure leads to overthinking, burnout, and losing focus on university or life in general.</p>

  <!-- Target Audience Research -->

    <div class="file-info">
      <p>I created a survey so i can better understand my target audience. With this survey my goals are to understand the reason of their current state, to see if they take any actions and if they do why the other tools doesn't help them and what will possibly motivate them. With this questions I also added a few for the app choices and what to input there that will make them more happy and will make the app usable for the purpose reason. For the next weeks I plan to gather all the responses and make a report of the survey.  <a href="https://forms.gle/XAwPGeZ4Gs3MRRLJ9" target="_blank">Click here for survey</a>

    <div class="file-info">
      <p>This app will feature a virtual companion—a modern Tamagotchi—that mirror you. It lives alongside you and reacts to how you manage your day.
        •	If you miss a task, skip a meal, or don’t study, your Tamagotchi will show signs of being sad, unmotivated, or tired. It might let out a small "aghhh" sound of disappointment.
        •	If you complete tasks, eat well, or take care of yourself, your Tamagotchi will cheer up and get a little sweet treat or reward.
        The app promotes emotional awareness and balance, not just productivity.

  <div class="file-info">
    <p>I did make some Canva page- prototype and started coding it because I never worked with apps so I wanted to see how long it will take me how it will be what I need etc. Once I got the idea, I started with defining and made survey for the target audience, brainstorming. After that  I started making the prototype (not finished) by first making a user flow, Ui sheet. I looked for inspirations and got many from Pinterest.I started with gathering ideas and get more material for my small projects which will be "self care pet" by having a pet that you need to take care of and will basically mirror you and your mental health.

  <a class="file-link toggle-info" href="javascript:void(0);">Set Up To Code</a>
  <div class="file-info">
    <p>Because I never made an app I wanted to code first something simple so i started on my research of what to use. I saw that Expo Go is used and later you can deploy the app also I asked Stan if its a good idea to use it and he said yes. So I started following a youtube tutorial on hot to set up and had to download some packages in my terminal but I finally succeded. i had problems of course but I also used Ai to help me see where is the problem and how to fix it. 
    </p>

<div class="file-card">
  <a class="file-link toggle-info" href="javascript:void(0);">Coding</a>
  <div class="file-info">
    <p>In my app, I first set a background image using the ImageBackground component to create a cozy and consistent visual environment. Then, I added a top-left stats panel showing the pet's level, experience (EXP), and energy. This is handled with a View styled with absolute positioning and updated dynamically using state variables like level, exp, and energy.<br>

      Below that, I created a set of interactive buttons (TouchableOpacity) that let the user wash the pet, switch between a cat and a dog, and open a shop. Each button updates the state (mood, isDog, showShop) to change the display or trigger animations.
      
      When the user taps the Shop button, a sliding animation reveals the shop using the Animated API and a slideAnim value. Inside the shop, I used a ScrollView and a custom grid layout to display animated food items. Each item is an Animated.View wrapped in a TouchableOpacity.
      
      When the user taps a food item:
      
      An animation is triggered (fading out and scaling up briefly).
      
      The app reduces the pet's energy by 1 (setEnergy).
      
      It also increases EXP by 5, and if EXP reaches 20, the app levels up the pet using a calculation (Math.floor(totalExp / 20)) and resets the remaining EXP.
      
      For energy tracking, I used an array to render ⚡ icons, and dimmed them when energy is low by changing the opacity. There's also a "Refill Energy" button to restore energy to the maximum.
      
      Lastly, I made sure that user progress is saved even when the app is closed or refreshed. I used AsyncStorage to persist the level, exp, and energy. On app load (useEffect), I retrieve the stored values, and whenever they change, I save the new values back to storage.</p>

            <p>Started drawing the logo in Adobe Illustrator each stripe on different layer so that later on I can animate it in after effects, used some effects from the tool to make it look like there is a zest falling also added a background that is going to match more in future, still in process. Showed it to the teachers and present it and got some feedback that will be implemented soon.Also the file was too big to upload in github so I compressed it thats why there is a watermark</p>

          <p>From my semester one i did went to a doctor and got diagnosed with pcos and my pcos recently got bad so i needed to schedule appoitment for a blood test (this blood test have to be made on the 1st to 3rd day of woman's cycle) before going to bulgaria so when i saw that there is the art department day and I didn't saw that its mandatory I decided to not go and schedule my appoitment that day. It's not a big reason not to go but this is the only reason i didn't went. Otherwise i would have go with Aleksa </p>
