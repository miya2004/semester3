          <p>Creating a brand guide is an essential step in building a consistent and recognizable identity. It serves as a clear reference that outlines how a brand should look, sound, and feel across different platforms and materials. By defining elements like logos, colors, fonts, and tone of voice, a brand guide ensures that everyone—from designers to marketers—represents the brand in a unified way.

            The team charter is a document that showcases the group members, roles, norms and rules. We decided to have a couple of roles (team lead, contactperson, quality master and note taker) within the group to make sure these tasks will be done. Every group member also had to write down their strengths and weaknesses, which helped us eventually divide tasks within the project. <br></p>

          These HMW questions helped me turn what users are struggling with into ideas I can actually design for. They let me explore different ways to make the app fun, creative, and supportive, especially for young people who feel lonely or awkward socially. They helped me later with brainstorming because basically I was brainstorming solutions and answers for those questions. The questions I and my group asked are based on interviews, surveys and research we did before that.

        <p>Once we chose that palette, we moved on to creating the UI sheet. That’s where we started putting together all the design elements like fonts, sizes, button styles, and things like that. Having this UI sheet is helping us a lot, because it keeps everything consistent throughout the app. So, no matter what screen we’re working on, we can make sure the design feels the same — same colors, same style, same tone. It’s made the whole process feel more organized and professional, and it's easier to prototype now because we’re not making design decisions from scratch each time.</p>

      <div class="file-info">
        <p>So, this is the user flow me and Lizzy worked on, and it really helped us structure our idea better. Basically, a user flow shows all the steps a person would take when using the app — from the moment they open it to the different actions they might take, like signing up, choosing hobbies, or joining events.<br><br>
          Me and Lizzy used different colors to categorize each page.The reason we made a user flow before jumping into prototyping is because it gives us a clear picture of the entire experience. We get to see how everything connects, what screens we need, where users might get stuck, and even where errors might happen — like we showed with the school email error.<br><br>
          It also helped us think logically about the features. For example, when we added the event section, we realized it wasn’t just “make an event” — users also need to add a location, pictures, and maybe even set a max number of people. All of that came from mapping it out in the flow first.<br><br>
          So overall, it’s a helpful step for organizing our ideas and making sure the app is usable before we spend time designing or coding anything
